# GLAB-370.1.1-FirstProgramWithPython

## Introduction
Welcome to GLAB-370.1.1! In this lab, you will learn how to write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python. We will also make the program interactive and engage the learner to create their own program at the end. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites
To complete this lab, you should have basic knowledge of programming concepts and some familiarity with Python. If you are new to Python, don't worry! This lab is designed to be beginner-friendly.

## Instructions

- [ ] **Step 1:** _Setting Up the Development Environment_
      - Before we begin coding, let's make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Follow these steps:
- [ ] **Step 2:** _Creating a New Python File_
      - Open your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
      - Create a new file and save it with a .py extension. For example, hello_world.py.
- [ ] **Step 3:** _Writing the Code_
      - Copy and paste the following code into your Python file:
      
      ```
      # Interactive Hello World Program

      name = input("Enter your name: ")

      print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to the world of Python!")
      ```

- [ ] **Step 4:** _Running the Program_
- To run the program, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.
- Type python hello_world.py (replace hello_world.py with the name you gave your file) and press Enter.
- You should see a prompt asking for your name. Enter your name and press Enter. The program will then display a personalized greeting.

- [ ] **Step 5:** _Making the Program Interactive_
      - Now, let's make the program more interactive by adding a prompt for the user to enter their age. Modify the code as follows:
        
        ```
        # Interactive Hello World Program
        name = input("Enter your name: ")
        age = input("Enter your age: ")

        print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to the world of Python!")
        print("You are " + age + " years old.")
        ```
        
      - Save the changes and run the program again. This time, you'll be prompted to enter both your name and age. The program will display your personalized greeting along with your age.

- [ ] **Step 6:** _Your Turn - Create Your Own Program_
- Congratulations on completing the interactive Hello World program! Now it's time to get creative.

- Think of a simple program idea and try to implement it using Python. It could be a calculator, a guessing game, or anything else you find interesting. Feel free to experiment and have fun with it!

- Remember to use the knowledge you gained from this lab, such as using input to get user input and print to display output. If you need any help, refer to the Python documentation or ask your instructor.

- Once you've finished creating your program, save it in a new Python file and run it to see the results.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you learned how to write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python and made it interactive by adding prompts for user input. You also got the opportunity to create your own program.

Keep exploring Python and practicing your programming skills. The possibilities are endless, and you're well on your way to becoming a proficient Python developer.
